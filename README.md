# Accept 2Checkout Payments Using Contact Form 7
The 2Checkout Payment system provides a secure, simple means of authorizing credit and debit card transactions from your website.

The 2Checkout system provides a straightforward payment interface for the customer. It takes complete responsibility for the onsite transaction, including collection and encrypted storage of credit and debit card details, eliminating the security implications of holding such sensitive information on your servers.

This plugin helps you to accept payments on your Contact Form 7 using 2Checkout Accounts.

# How To Use

You can use the Country field tag option to display country in the drop-down if you are going with the custom approach, you need to set the drop-down value in ISO 3166 ( Examples: GB,IE, and DE ), so we prefer to use our tag to display country list.
